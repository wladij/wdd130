        <p>Hello everyone, so that you can get to know me a little better, 
            I want you to have a few more seconds to see the image on this page, 
            for me it is very important, and it represents a lot of what I am now and what I have.
            I am married to Angie Zambrano, we are from Ecuador, we got married by civil ceremony on December 29, 2022, 
            we were sealed for time and eternity in the temple of Guayaquil-Ecuador on September 1, Angie is 13 weeks pregnant.</p>
        <p>I like programming and I hope to learn how to develop web pages and much more.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite scriptures is found in 1 Nephi 17:51, the lord has all the power 
            and I know he will guide me and show me and teach me how to do it.</p>
